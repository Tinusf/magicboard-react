## Getting started

```
yarn install
```

To start project:
There is a `App_copy.js` file that shows the template for the board structure. Make a duplicate and rename it `App.js`.

```
yarn start
```

`App.js` defines the structure of the elements in the grid. We use css-grids to place the cells around.
